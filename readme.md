  transcript: 'Patient has a history of shortness of breath and fatigue.'
});

// Example request to clinicalNote endpoint
const response2 = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/llm/clinicalNote', {
  transcript: 'The patient is suffering from chronic headaches.',
  input: 'Please provide possible diagnoses.'
});

// Example request to cdsHelperddx endpoint
const response3 = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/llm/cdsHelperddx', {
  transcript: 'The patient complains of chest pain and dizziness.'
});

// Example request to cdsHelperQA endpoint
const response4 = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/llm/cdsHelperQA', {
  transcript: 'The patient has been experiencing unexplained weight loss.'
});

// Example request to PatientInstruction endpoint
const response5 = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/llm/PatientInstruction', {
  history: 'The patient has a medical history of hypertension and diabetes.',
  input: 'Provide detailed instructions for managing these conditions.',
  doc_summary: 'The patient is currently on medication for both hypertension and diabetes.'
